            <p className="text-lg font-semibold">It is a blessing if a person is born with no health issues. Yet, no one should take advantage of being healthy and be overconfident. Being healthy is about having good physical health and being mentally and socially fit. A healthy person can be more focused and more determined and can lead a happy life. If we look into human history, the biggest asset to human beings is good health and a healthy mind. Good health and a calm mind are interrelated, which helps individuals grow intellectually and make them wealthy. A person with poor mental health is unable to sustain physical strength and stamina. Only a stress-free mind and a positive mindset may contribute to good physical health. This combination allows us to recognise and experience the actual eternal happiness that comes from the inside. We’re told as children that leading a healthy lifestyle can lead to the best health. However, only as we get older do we realise that introspection, self-awareness, and reflection of one’s own ideas are all essential aspects of sustaining excellent mental health, which may lead to a fit and lovely physique. When this method is missing, it might lead to a depressing thought process in which one fails to realise what is bothering them and what they are missing in particular. As a result, maintaining good health is critical for the general development of our personality and outlook on life.</p>
